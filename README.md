# Pig-Dice
#### This project is a website based game emulating the nomal rolling and tossing of a dice
#### By **Max Maina**
## Description
Players throw a dice and scores as many points as the total shown on the dice providing the dice doesnâ€™t roll to a 1. The player may continue rolling and accumulating points (but risking not to roll a 1) as this will end his/her turn,maning that they lose all points they accumulated that turn, and they pass the dice to the next player. The game goes on where the dice passes from player to player until a winner is determined. The first player to score 100 or more wins the game.
