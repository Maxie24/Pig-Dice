        <p><i>Pig,</i> is a simple dice game from 1945 and is played by many rule variations.
        It has a couple of versions including Pass The Pigs, Pig Dice2 and Skunk Pig.
      Pig Dice is commonly used as a math concept to teach and emphasise on probability.

          <h3>G a m e  p l a y</h3>
          <li>Each player should repeatedly roll the dice untill either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to hold</li>
          <li>If a player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next players turn.</li>
          <li>What if the player rolls another number? the numbers are added to their turn total and the player continues</li>
          <li>If a player chooses to hold, their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next players turn</li>
        </p>
        <p>--The first player to score 100 or more points wins.<br>
        For example, the first player, Winnie, begins a turn with a roll of 5. Winnie could hold and score 5 points, but
        chooses to roll again. Winnie rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to roll again.
        Winnie rolls a 1, and must end her turn without scoring. The next player, Max, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-5, after
        which he chooses to hold, and adds his turn total of 22 points to his score.</p>
